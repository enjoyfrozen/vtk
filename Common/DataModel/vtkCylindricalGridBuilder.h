 * @class   vtkCylindricalGridBuilder
 * @brief   a utility for building cylindrical cells around the z axis
 *
 * vtkCylindricalGridBuilder is a utility class for building cylindrical cells for an unstructured
 * grid. These cells have a radial curvature, up to and including a complete ring about the z axis.
 * Cells are represented by a cartesian radius, polar theta rotation angle about the origin, and a
 * cartesian z height.
