![VTK - The Visualization Toolkit][vtk-banner]

Introduction
============

The Visualization Toolkit (VTK) is a robust and open-source software
system that provides advanced features in 3D computer graphics, image
processing, modeling, volume rendering, and scientific visualization.
It offers threaded and distributed-memory parallel processing for
scalability and better performance.

VTK is a cross-platform library that can run on many operating systems,
including Windows, macOS, Linux, and even the web and mobile devices.

The origin of VTK is with the textbook "The Visualization Toolkit, an
Object-Oriented Approach to 3D Graphics" originally published by
Prentice Hall and now published by Kitware, Inc. (Third Edition ISBN
1-930934-07-6). VTK has grown (since its initial release in 1994) to a
world-wide user base in the commercial, academic, and research
communities.
