![VTK - The Visualization Toolkit][vtk-banner]

Introduction
============

The Visualization Toolkit (VTK) is a robust and open-source software
system that provides advanced features in 3D computer graphics, image
processing, modeling, volume rendering, and scientific visualization.
It offers threaded and distributed-memory parallel processing for
scalability and better performance.

VTK is a cross-platform library that can run on many operating systems,
including Windows, macOS, Linux, and even the web and mobile devices.

The origin of VTK is with the textbook "The Visualization Toolkit, an
Object-Oriented Approach to 3D Graphics" originally published by
Prentice Hall and now published by Kitware, Inc. (Third Edition ISBN
1-930934-07-6). VTK has grown (since its initial release in 1994) to a
world-wide user base in the commercial, academic, and research
communities.

Learning Resources
==================

* General information is available at the [VTK Homepage][vtk-homepage].

* Community discussion takes place on the [VTK Discourse][vtk-discourse] forum.

* Commercial [support and training][kitware-support]
  are available from [Kitware][].

* Doxygen-generated nightly reference documentation is
  available [online][vtk-doxygen].

* There is now a large collection of [VTK Examples][vtk-examples] that
  showcase VTK features and provide a useful learning resource.

Reporting Bugs
==============

If you have found a bug:

1. If you have a patch, please read the [CONTRIBUTING.md][vtk-contributing] document.

2. Otherwise, please join the [VTK Discourse][vtk-discourse] forum and ask
   about the expected and observed behaviors to determine if it is
   really a bug.

3. Finally, if the issue is not resolved by the above steps, open
   an entry in the [VTK Issue Tracker][vtk-issues].

Requirements
============

In general VTK tries to be as portable as possible; see [Supported Hardware][vtk-supported-hardware]
and [Build Prerequisites][vtk-build] for more information.

Building
========

The [Building][vtk-build] page describes how to build and install VTK. It covers building
for development, on both Unix-type systems (Linux, HP-UX, Solaris, macOS), and Windows.
