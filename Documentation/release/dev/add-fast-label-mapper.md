## Add vtkFastLabeledDataMapper

This mapper uses GPU texture acceleration to draw labels at much
higher frame rates. When hundreds or thousands of labels are on
screen at one time, existing mappers can drop below 1 fps. This
acceleration is designed to render the same number of labels at
over 60 fps so a user can label many points while retaining
interactive rotations and animations.
