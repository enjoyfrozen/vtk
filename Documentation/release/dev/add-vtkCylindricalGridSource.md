## Add vtkCylindricalGridSource

Adds vtkCylindricalGridSource to build cylindrical grids;
unstructured grids with cells that have radial curvature,
up to and including complete rings.

Cells are represented by a cartesian radius, polar theta
rotation angle about the origin, and a cartesian z height.
