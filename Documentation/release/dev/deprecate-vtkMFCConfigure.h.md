# vtkMFCConfigure.h deprecated

The `vtkMFCConfigure.h` header has been deprecated. This was only used to
provide information relevant to how to build the module itself and therefore is
not relevant to external users. As such, there is no replacement and code can
just remove the inclusion without losing any relevant information.
