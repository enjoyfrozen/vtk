## Add Filters/GeometryPreview module

The Filters/GeometryPreview module has been added which includes filters for creating a
preview of the geometry of a dataset. As of now, it includes the `vtkPointSetToOctreeImageFilter`
and `vtkOctreeImageToPointSetFilter` filters.

1) `vtkPointSetToOctreeImageFilter` can be used to convert a point set to an image with a specific size and an unsigned
   char octree cell array. Each bit of the unsigned char indicates if the point-set had a point close to one of the 8
   corners of the cell. It can optionally also output a cell array based on an input point array. This array will have 1
   or many components that represent different functions i.e. last value, min, max, count, sum, mean.
2) `vtkOctreeImageToPointSetFilter` can be used to convert an image with an unsigned char octree cell array to a point
   set. Each bit of the unsigned char indicates if the cell had a point close to one its 8 corners. It can optionally
   also output a point array based on an input cell array. This array will have 1 of the components of the input array.
