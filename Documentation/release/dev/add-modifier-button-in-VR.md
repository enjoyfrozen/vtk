## Add a modifier button in VR

A modifier action has been added in virtual reality. Pressing the corresponding controller
button enters a "modifier" state. This changes the behavior of certain actions.

Currently, this modifier only applies to the Grab and Pick actions (assigned to the right trigger).
The modified versions of these actions grab/pick all objects of the VR scene rather than only
the one that is picked.

The modifier action is mapped to the following buttons for supported controllers:
- HP Motion: left Y button
- HTC Vive: left menu button
- Oculus Touch: left Y button
- Valve Index: left B button
