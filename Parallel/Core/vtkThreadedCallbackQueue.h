/**
 * @class vtkThreadedCallbackQueue
 * @brief simple threaded callback queue
 *
 * This callback queue executes pushed functions and functors on threads whose
 * purpose is to execute those functions.
 * By default, one thread is created by this class, so it is advised to set `NumberOfThreads`.
 * Upon destruction of an instance of this callback queue, remaining unexecuted threads are
 * executed.
 *
 * All public methods of this class are thread safe.
 *
 * @warning All pushed tasks MUST terminate! If not, one could end up with a deadlock when using
 * `vtkCallbackTokenBase::Wait()` on the token associated with this task.

  /**
   * Pushes a function f to be passed args... as arguments.
   * f will be called as soon as a running thread has the occasion to do so, in a FIFO fashion.
   * This method returns a `Token`, which is an object
   * allowing to synchronize the code at will through the use of a `std::shared_future`.
   * This method is thread-safe.
   *
   * All the arguments of `Push` are stored persistently inside the queue. An argument passed as an
   * lvalue reference will trigger a copy constructor call. It is thus advised, when possible, to
   * pass rvalue references or smart pointers (`vtkSmartPointer` or `std::shared_ptr` for example)
   *
   * The input function can be a pointer function, a lambda expression, a `std::function`
   * a functor or a member function pointer.
   *
   * If f is a functor, its copy constructor will be invoked if it is passed as an lvalue reference.
   * Consequently, if the functor is somewhat heavy, it is adviced to pass it as an rvalue reference
   * or to wrap inside a smart pointer (`std::unique_ptr` for example).
   *
   * If f is a member function pointer, an instance of its host class needs to be provided in the
   * second parameter. Similar to the functor case, it is advised in order to avoid calling the copy
   * constructor to pass it as an rvalue reference or to wrap it inside a smart pointer.
   *
   * Below is a short example showing off different possible insertions to this queue:
   *
   * @code
   *   struct S {
   *    void operator()(int) {}
   *    void f() {}
   *    void f_const() {}
   *   };
   *   void f(S&&, const S&) {}
   *
   *   vtkNew<vtkThreadedCallbackQueue> queue;
   *   int x;
   *   S s;
   *
   *   // Pushing a lambda expression.
   *   queue->Push([]{});
   *
   *   // Pushing a function pointer
   *   // Note that the copy constructor is called for s
   *   queue->Push(&f, s, S());
   *
   *   // Pushing a functor.
   *   queue->Push(S(), x);
   *
   *   // Pushing a functor wrapped inside a smart pointer.
   *   queue->Push(std::unique_ptr<S>(new S()), x);
   *
   *   // Pushing a member function pointer.
   *   // Don't forget to pass an instance of the host class.
   *   queue->Push(&S::f, S());
   *
   *   // Pushing a const member function pointer.
   *   // This time, we wrap the instance of the host class inside a smart pointer.
   *   queue->Push(&S::f_const, std::unique_ptr<S>(new S()));
   * @endcode
   *
   * @warning DO NOT capture lvalue references in a lambda expression pushed into the queue
   * unless you can ensure that the function will be executed in the same scope where the input
   * lives. If not, such captures may be destroyed before the lambda is invoked by the queue.
