/**
 * @class vtkThreadedCallbackQueue
 * @brief simple threaded callback queue
 *
 * This callback queue executes pushed functions and functors on threads whose
 * purpose is to execute those functions. When instantiating
 * this class, no threads are spawned yet. They are spawned upon calling `Start()`.
 * By default, one thread is created by this class, so it is advised to set `NumberOfThreads`.
 * Upon destruction of an instance of this callback queue, remaining unexecuted threads are
 * executed, unless `IsRunning()` returns `false`.
 *
 * All public methods of this class are thread safe.
